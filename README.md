### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Next.js 14 with App Router**: Chosen for its built-in API routes, server-side rendering capabilities, and excellent developer experience. The App Router provides better performance and developer ergonomics compared to the Pages Router.

2. **PostgreSQL Database**: Selected for its robust ACID compliance, excellent performance with complex queries, and strong support for concurrent operations - essential for queue management and financial transactions.

3. **WebSocket Integration**: Implemented for real-time queue updates and display monitor synchronization, ensuring instant updates across all connected clients without polling overhead.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented at the middleware level to ensure secure access to different system areas based on user roles (Admin, Sales, Cashier).

5. **Microservice-Ready Architecture**: While currently monolithic, the layered structure allows for easy extraction of services (queue management, notifications, reporting) into separate microservices as the system scales.

| ST-901.2 | **View User Accounts:** The Admin can view a complete list of all non-Admin users in a table displaying Full Name, Email, Role, and current Status (e.g., Active/Inactive). |
| ST-901.3 | **Edit User Account:** The Admin can edit an existing user's `Full Name` and `Role`. The `Email` (login ID) cannot be changed after creation. |
| ST-901.4 | **Manage User Status (Deactivation):** The Admin can change a user's status between 'Active' and 'Inactive'. An 'Inactive' user cannot log in, preserving their historical data. |
| ST-901.5 | **Manual Password Reset:** The Admin can trigger a password reset link to be sent to a user's registered email. |
| ST-902 | **Dropdown Management:** Admin can add, edit, or remove options from the `Grade Type` and `Lens Type` dropdown lists. |
| ST-903 | **Counter Management:** Admin can define the names and number of service counters that appear on the Display Monitor. |

---

## 14. Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL 12+
- npm or yarn

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd escashop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories
   - Configure your database connection and other settings

4. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This command launches both the backend API (port 5000) and frontend React app (port 3000) concurrently with separated logs.

### Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | **Primary development command** - Runs both backend and frontend servers concurrently |
| `npm run dev:backend` | Runs only the backend server in development mode |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Runs only the frontend React development server |
| `npm run build` | Builds both backend and frontend for production |
| `npm start` | Starts the production backend server |

### Development URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:5000/api-docs (if available)

### Troubleshooting

**Login Issues:**
- Ensure both servers are running (`npm run dev`)
- Check that the backend is accessible at http://localhost:5000
- Verify database connection in backend logs
- Check browser console for network errors
- Default admin credentials should be available in your database setup

**Port Conflicts:**
- Backend uses port 5000, frontend uses port 3000
- If ports are in use, update the configuration in the respective `.env` files

**Database Issues:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- Check database connection string in `backend/.env`
- Run database migrations if needed

### RBAC & Permission Issues

**INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS Errors:**
1. **Check User Role**: Verify the logged-in user has the required role
   ```bash
   # Use debug endpoint to check token info
   GET /api/debug/token-info
   Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
   ```

2. **Debug Token Contents**: Use JWT debugging tools
   ```bash
   # Test specific role permissions
   POST /api/debug/test-permissions
   {
     "test_role": "admin",
     "required_roles": ["admin", "super_admin"]
   }
   ```

3. **Check Server Logs**: Look for detailed access denied messages
   ```
   Access denied for user john@example.com (cashier) to /api/admin/users.
   Required roles: admin, super_admin
   ```

4. **Role Hierarchy**: Ensure you understand the role hierarchy
   - SUPER_ADMIN (Level 4) - Highest privileges
   - ADMIN (Level 3) - Administrative functions  
   - SALES (Level 2) - Sales operations
   - CASHIER (Level 1) - Basic cashier operations

**Missing SUPER_ADMIN Role:**
- Update database constraints to allow SUPER_ADMIN role:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS users_role_check;
  ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_role_check 
    CHECK (role IN ('super_admin', 'admin', 'sales', 'cashier'));
  ```

### WebSocket Connection Issues

**Connection Failures:**
1. **Check WebSocket URL**: Ensure correct WebSocket endpoint
   ```javascript
   const socket = io('ws://localhost:5000', {
     auth: { token: 'your-jwt-token' }
   });
   ```

2. **Authentication Issues**: Verify JWT token is valid and included
   ```javascript
   // Check token in browser storage
   const token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
   console.log('Token:', token);
   ```

3. **Network Tab Debugging**: Check browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Look for WebSocket connection attempts
   - Check for 401/403 authentication errors
   - Verify WebSocket upgrade headers

**Payment Status Update Issues:**
1. **Subscription Problems**: Ensure proper subscription to payment events
   ```javascript
   socket.emit('subscribe:payment_status');
   
   socket.on('payment_status_updated', (data) => {
     console.log('Payment update:', data);
   });
   ```

2. **Role-Based Access**: Verify user role allows payment subscriptions
   - Admin: Full access to all payment updates
   - Cashier: Updates for transactions they handle
   - Sales: Updates for transactions they created

3. **Event Structure**: Check received event payload format
   ```javascript
   {
     transactionId: number,
     payment_status: string,      // 'unpaid', 'partial', 'paid'
     balance_amount: number,      // Remaining balance
     paid_amount: number,         // Amount already paid
     customer_id: number,
     or_number: string,
     updatedBy: string,
     timestamp: Date
   }
   ```

**Settlement Processing Issues:**
1. **Database Deadlocks**: If experiencing concurrent settlement issues
   - Avoid rapid successive settlement requests
   - Check server logs for deadlock error messages
   - Implement client-side rate limiting

2. **Processing Loops**: Signs of recursive status recalculation
   ```bash
   # Look for these patterns in logs:
   Multiple concurrent INSERT operations
   UPDATE transactions stuck in loops
   WebSocket event multiplication
   ```

3. **Lock Contention**: Database connection issues during settlements
   - Monitor PostgreSQL connections: 
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
     ```
   - Check for idle in transaction states
   - Restart application if persistent deadlocks occur

### Contributing
