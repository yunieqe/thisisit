# PaymentSettlementService Implementation Summary

## ✅ Task Completion Status: COMPLETED

### Implementation Details

#### 1. PaymentSettlementService (`src/services/paymentSettlementService.ts`)
- **createSettlement()** method:
  - Validates partial payment rules
  - Prevents overpayment (amount cannot exceed remaining balance)
  - Validates payment mode against PaymentMode enum
  - Inserts settlement record in database transaction
  - Calls `TransactionService.updatePaymentStatus()` to update transaction status
  - Emits WebSocket events for real-time updates
  - Returns updated transaction and settlement history

- **getSettlements()** method:
  - Retrieves all settlements for a transaction
  - Includes cashier name via JOIN with users table
  - Orders by payment date (newest first)

#### 2. REST Endpoints (`src/routes/transactions.ts`)
- **POST `/transactions/:id/settlements`**:
  - Request body: `{amount, payment_mode, cashier_id}`
  - Comprehensive input validation
  - Requires CASHIER or ADMIN role
  - Returns: `{transaction, settlements}`

- **GET `/transactions/:id/settlements`**:
  - Returns array of settlements for a transaction
  - Includes cashier names and payment details
  - Accessible to all authenticated users

#### 3. Validation Rules Implemented
- ✅ Amount must be positive
- ✅ Payment mode must be valid (cash, gcash, maya, bank_transfer, credit_card)
- ✅ Cashier ID must be valid
- ✅ Settlement amount cannot exceed remaining balance
- ✅ Transaction must exist
- ✅ Proper error handling with meaningful messages

#### 4. Database Integration
- ✅ Uses existing `payment_settlements` table
- ✅ Maintains data integrity with transactions
- ✅ Automatic rollback on errors
- ✅ Proper connection pooling

#### 5. Real-time Updates
- ✅ WebSocket events emitted on settlement creation
- ✅ Event type: `payment_settlement_created`
- ✅ Includes updated transaction and settlement data

#### 6. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Both endpoints require authentication
- ✅ POST endpoint requires CASHIER or ADMIN role
- ✅ Activity logging for audit trail

#### 7. Error Handling
- ✅ Input validation errors (400 Bad Request)
- ✅ Business logic errors (400 Bad Request)
- ✅ Database errors (500 Internal Server Error)
- ✅ Transaction not found (404 Not Found)

#### 8. Testing & Documentation
- ✅ Basic test structure created
- ✅ Comprehensive API documentation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build process verified
