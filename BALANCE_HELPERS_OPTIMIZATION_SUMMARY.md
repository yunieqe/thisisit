# Balance Helpers Optimization Summary

## Task: Update balance helpers (paid_amount / balance_amount)

This document summarizes the changes made to optimize balance helper queries and add explicit numeric casting to prevent JavaScript string→number conversion issues.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Optimized Query Performance
- **File**: `backend/src/services/transaction.ts`
- **Method**: `TransactionService.list()`
- **Change**: Added `includePaymentDetails` flag to conditionally compute `paid_amount` and `balance_amount` only when needed
- **Benefit**: Reduces unnecessary computation in queries that don't require payment balance details

#### 2. Added Explicit Numeric Casting
Added explicit `CAST(column AS NUMERIC)::FLOAT` for all monetary fields to prevent JavaScript string→number surprises:

**Files Updated:**
- `backend/src/services/transaction.ts`:
  - `findById()` method: Added casts for `paid_amount` and `balance_amount`
  - `findByOrNumber()` method: Added casts for `paid_amount` and `balance_amount`
  - `list()` method: Added conditional casts when `includePaymentDetails` is true

- `backend/src/services/paymentSettlementService.ts`:
  - `getSettlements()` method: Added cast for `amount` field

#### 3. Daily Summary Optimization Confirmed
- **Verified**: Daily summary queries correctly use `amount` field instead of `balance_amount`
- **Location**: `TransactionService.getDailySummary()` method properly uses transaction `amount` for reporting
- **Benefit**: Ensures daily reports reflect transaction totals, not payment balances

#### 4. Route Updates
- **File**: `backend/src/routes/transactions.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Transaction listing route now uses `includePaymentDetails: true`
  - Export route now uses `includePaymentDetails: true`
- **Benefit**: Maintains backward compatibility while allowing optimization for other use cases

### Technical Details

#### Query Optimization Pattern
```sql
-- Old approach (always computed):
SELECT t.*, t.paid_amount, t.balance_amount, t.payment_status

-- New approach (conditional):
SELECT t.*, 
       ${includePaymentDetails ? 'CAST(t.paid_amount AS NUMERIC)::FLOAT as paid_amount, CAST(t.balance_amount AS NUMERIC)::FLOAT as balance_amount, t.payment_status,' : ''}
```

#### Numeric Casting Pattern
```sql
-- Ensures JavaScript receives proper numbers, not strings
CAST(t.paid_amount AS NUMERIC)::FLOAT as paid_amount
CAST(t.balance_amount AS NUMERIC)::FLOAT as balance_amount
CAST(ps.amount AS NUMERIC)::FLOAT as amount
```

### Impact

1. **Performance**: Queries that don't need payment details run faster
2. **Reliability**: Explicit casting prevents JavaScript type conversion issues
3. **Correctness**: Daily summaries correctly use transaction amounts
4. **Maintainability**: Clear flag indicates when payment details are needed

### Backward Compatibility

All existing API endpoints maintain the same response structure. The optimization is transparent to client applications while improving server-side performance.
