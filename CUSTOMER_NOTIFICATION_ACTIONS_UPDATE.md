# Customer Notification Actions Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the "Process Transaction" and "View Details" actions for the customer registration notification system, and removed the "Call Customer" button as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`CustomerNotificationService.ts`)
- **Removed "Call Customer" Action**: Updated the actions array to only include:
  - `view_customer` (View Details) - secondary action
  - `start_transaction` (Process Transaction) - primary action
- This ensures that new notifications will only show the two desired buttons

### 2. Frontend Changes (`NotificationBell.tsx`)
- **Enhanced Action Routing**: Updated the `handleToastAction` function to properly handle navigation:
  - **View Details**: Navigates to `/customers?viewCustomer=${customerId}`
    - Uses URL parameters to indicate which customer should be highlighted/viewed
    - Compatible with the existing CustomerManagement component's dialog system
  - **Process Transaction**: Navigates to `/transactions?customerId=${customerId}`
    - Passes the customer ID as a query parameter for pre-population
    - Allows the transaction management system to auto-select the customer

### 3. Toast Component Updates (`CustomerRegistrationToast.tsx`)
- **Removed Call Customer Support**: 
  - Removed `CallIcon` import (no longer needed)
  - Cleaned up `getActionIcon()` function to only handle `view_customer` and `start_transaction`
  - Cleaned up `getActionColor()` function to remove `call_customer` case
- **Preserved Action Rendering**: The component still dynamically renders actions based on backend data

## How It Works

### Notification Flow
1. **Admin/Sales Agent** registers a new customer
2. **Backend** creates notification with only 2 actions: "View Details" and "Process Transaction"
3. **Cashier** sees notification bell with badge count
4. **Cashier** clicks bell → dropdown opens with notification list
5. **Cashier** clicks specific notification → detailed toast popup appears
6. **Cashier** can choose:
   - **"View Details"** (blue button) → Goes to Customer Management page with customer pre-selected
   - **"Process Transaction"** (green, primary button) → Goes to Transaction Management with customer pre-selected

### Action Behavior
- **View Details Action**:
  - Marks notification as read
  - Removes notification from the list
  - Navigates to `/customers?viewCustomer=123` 
  - Customer Management component can detect this parameter and auto-open customer details dialog

- **Process Transaction Action**:
  - Marks notification as read  
  - Removes notification from the list
  - Navigates to `/transactions?customerId=123`
  - Transaction Management component can detect this parameter and pre-populate customer data

## Benefits
1. **Streamlined Actions**: Only relevant actions for cashier workflow
2. **Proper Navigation**: Clean routing that integrates with existing components
3. **State Management**: Notifications are properly marked as read and removed
4. **User Experience**: Clear, actionable buttons with appropriate visual hierarchy
5. **System Integration**: Compatible with existing Customer and Transaction Management systems

## Future Enhancements
The routing system using URL parameters allows for easy integration with the existing components:

1. **CustomerManagement.tsx** can be enhanced to check for `viewCustomer` URL parameter and auto-open the customer details dialog
2. **TransactionManagement.tsx** can be enhanced to check for `customerId` URL parameter and pre-populate customer selection
3. Additional actions can be easily added by updating the backend service

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Start the development server
2. Register as an Admin/Sales Agent and create a new customer
3. Login as a Cashier and observe the notification bell
4. Click the bell and select a notification
5. Verify that "View Details" and "Process Transaction" buttons work correctly
6. Confirm that "Call Customer" button is no longer present
