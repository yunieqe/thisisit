# SPA Routing Fix for Production Deployment

## Problem
The reset password functionality was working in development but showing "Not Found" error in production when accessing URLs like:
`https://escashop-frontend.onrender.com/reset-password/[token]`

## Root Cause
**Single Page Application (SPA) Routing Issue**: When users visit a direct URL in production, the server looked for that physical file path instead of letting React Router handle it client-side.

In development, the dev server automatically handles SPA routing, but production static hosting requires explicit configuration.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added `_redirects` file
**File**: `frontend/public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
This tells Render to serve `index.html` for all routes, letting React Router handle routing client-side.

### 2. Added `.htaccess` file (backup)
**File**: `frontend/public/.htaccess` 
```apache
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```
Backup configuration for Apache-based servers.

### 3. Updated Render configuration
**File**: `render.yaml`
- Updated build timestamp to force fresh deployment
- Added cache headers to prevent stale content issues

## How It Works
1. User visits `https://escashop-frontend.onrender.com/reset-password/token`
2. Render server sees the `_redirects` rule
3. Server returns `index.html` with HTTP 200 status
4. React app loads and React Router processes the URL
5. ResetPassword component renders correctly

## Verification Steps
After deployment completes (~5-10 minutes):
1. Visit any reset password link
2. Should see the password reset form instead of "Not Found"
3. Check browser developer tools for API calls and debugging logs

## Files Changed
- `frontend/public/_redirects` (new)
- `frontend/public/.htaccess` (new) 
- `render.yaml` (updated)

## Deployment
Changes committed and pushed to trigger automatic Render redeployment.
The fix should be live once the deployment completes.
