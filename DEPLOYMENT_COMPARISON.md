## Recommendation

**For EscaShop:** I recommend **Railway** because:
1. **Better monorepo handling** - works seamlessly with your backend/frontend structure
2. **More generous free tier** - $5 credit vs limited hours
3. **Simpler setup** - fewer configuration files needed
4. **Better for development** - no cold starts issues
