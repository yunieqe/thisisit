# EscaShop Changelog - July 26, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing critical database migrations and implementing comprehensive Docker deployment with secure authentication management. All database migrations are now successfully running, and the application is Docker-ready with production-grade security configurations.

### Migration 004 - Payment System Enhancements
**Status**: ✅ FIXED AND WORKING

**Issues Resolved:**

- Payment status updates now work correctly without touching generated columns

**Successfully Enhanced:**
- ✅ Payment tracking with enhanced monitoring
- ✅ Duplicate prevention for settlements
- ✅ Enhanced reporting capabilities
- ✅ Automatic payment status calculation

## 🐳 Docker Implementation

### Files Created:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Complete multi-service Docker setup
- `.env.docker` - Environment variable template
- `scripts/generate-secrets.sh` - Secure secrets generation script
- `secrets/` directory structure for sensitive data management

### Docker Services Configured:
1. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Alpine-based for smaller footprint
   - Health checks implemented
   - Data persistence with named volumes
   - Password managed via Docker secrets

2. **Redis Cache**
   - Session and cache management
   - Password-protected
   - Health checks implemented

3. **Backend API**
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile ready
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - Secrets mounting for sensitive data
   - Health checks and dependency management

4. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - Production build configuration
   - Environment variable injection
   - Health checks implemented

5. **Nginx Reverse Proxy**
   - Load balancing configuration
   - SSL termination ready
   - Static file serving

## 🔐 Security Enhancements

### 1. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive environment variable mapping
- ✅ Separation of sensitive and non-sensitive config
- ✅ Docker secrets integration for sensitive data
- ✅ Template files for easy deployment setup

### 2. Secure Token Management
- ✅ JWT secrets managed through Docker secrets (not environment variables)
- ✅ Separate access and refresh token secrets
- ✅ Token rotation enabled by default
- ✅ Secure random generation script (128-bit JWT secrets)
- ✅ Cookie-based refresh token storage with security flags

### 3. Proxy and Load Balancing
- ✅ Trust proxy settings configured for Docker networking
- ✅ CORS properly configured for Docker environment
- ✅ Production-ready proxy configurations
- ✅ Rate limiting preserved in containerized environment

### 4. Logging and Monitoring
- ✅ Structured logging configuration
- ✅ Log persistence through Docker volumes
- ✅ Authentication activity logging maintained
- ✅ Error tracking and monitoring ready
- ✅ Health check endpoints for all services

## 🧪 Testing Preparation

### Authentication Testing Ready:
- JWT token validation in containerized environment
- Session management across container restarts
- CORS functionality with proper origins
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Database connection pooling
- WebSocket authentication

### Commands to Test:
```bash
# Generate secrets first
chmod +x scripts/generate-secrets.sh
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh

# Start the application
docker-compose up --build

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost/health
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```
