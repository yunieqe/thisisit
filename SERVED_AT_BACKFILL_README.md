# Served At Column Back-fill Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Step 3: Handle existing data for served_at column in the queue management system.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- The `served_at` column was added to the `customers` table in migration `012_add_served_at_to_customers.sql`
- This column uses `TIMESTAMPTZ` to store when a customer was served (completed or cancelled)

### 2. Back-fill Logic Implementation

#### Files Created:
1. **`backfill_served_at.sql`** - Raw SQL script for manual execution
2. **`backend/scripts/backfill-served-at.js`** - Node.js script for safe execution with logging

#### Back-fill Strategy:
```sql
UPDATE customers
SET served_at = updated_at
WHERE served_at IS NULL
  AND queue_status = 'completed'
  AND updated_at IS NOT NULL;
```

**Rationale**: The `updated_at` column gets set to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` when customers are marked as completed in the `completeService()` method, making it a reliable source for the completion time.

### 3. Code Updates

#### Queue Service Updates (`backend/src/services/queue.ts`):

1. **`completeService()` method** (lines 324-332):
   - Now sets `served_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` when completing customers
   - Ensures future completed customers have accurate served timestamps

2. **`cancelService()` method** (lines 389-398):
   - Now sets `served_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` when cancelling customers
   - Treats cancelled customers as "served" since they finished their queue experience

3. **`resetQueue()` method** (lines 853-862):
   - Now sets `served_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for customers completed during queue reset
   - Maintains data consistency during administrative operations

### 4. Data Integrity

#### Current Behavior:
- **New completed customers**: Get `served_at` set automatically
- **New cancelled customers**: Get `served_at` set automatically
- **Existing completed customers**: Need back-fill migration (see below)

#### Null Handling:
- The snapshot query in `DailyQueueResetService.ts` already branches on NULL values
- Analytics queries handle NULL `served_at` values gracefully
- If no suitable source exists, leaving `served_at` as NULL is acceptable

## Running the Back-fill Migration

### Option 1: Using Node.js Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/backfill-served-at.js
```

### Option 2: Using Raw SQL
```bash
psql -d escashop -f backfill_served_at.sql
```

### Option 3: Manual Database Connection
Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:
```sql
UPDATE customers
SET served_at = updated_at
WHERE served_at IS NULL
  AND queue_status = 'completed'
  AND updated_at IS NOT NULL;
```

## Verification

After running the migration, verify the results:

```sql
SELECT 
  queue_status,
  COUNT(*) as total_customers,
  COUNT(served_at) as customers_with_served_at,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(served_at) as customers_missing_served_at
FROM customers
WHERE queue_status IN ('completed', 'cancelled')
GROUP BY queue_status
ORDER BY queue_status;
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Analytics Queries**: Now can use `served_at` for accurate service time calculations
2. **Performance**: Index on `served_at` already exists from migration `012_add_served_at_to_customers.sql`
3. **Reporting**: Historical reports can now include accurate completion timestamps

## Migration Safety

- ✅ Uses transaction with rollback capability
- ✅ Only updates NULL values (idempotent)
- ✅ Preserves existing data integrity
- ✅ Includes comprehensive logging and verification
- ✅ Does not affect active queue operations

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Created**: `backfill_served_at.sql`
2. **Created**: `backend/scripts/backfill-served-at.js`
3. **Created**: `SERVED_AT_BACKFILL_README.md`
4. **Modified**: `backend/src/services/queue.ts`
   - Updated `completeService()` method
   - Updated `cancelService()` method
   - Updated `resetQueue()` method

The implementation ensures that both existing and future customers have proper `served_at` timestamps for accurate queue analytics and reporting.
